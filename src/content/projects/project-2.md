Task Management System is designed to explore the capabilities of Vue and NestJS. It features a Vue frontend with drag-and-drop functionality for intuitive task management. Authentication and refresh tokens are managed using NestJS, ensuring secure user sessions. The entire system is containerized with Docker Compose, and NGINX is used for efficient load balancing and serving the application.
