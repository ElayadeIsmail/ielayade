I led the full development lifecycle of multiple projects, leveraging React, Next.js, Tailwind CSS, Node.js, Express, and Nest.js to build robust web applications. I also designed and implemented RESTful APIs, integrating various third-party services to ensure seamless communication between front-end and back-end systems.
